# Customer Churn Prediction with NLP Insights

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the telecom sector using a combination of machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to analyze customer data, apply data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA), and ultimately build a predictive model to identify customers at risk of churning. Additionally, sentiment analysis is performed on customer feedback to extract valuable insights related to churn.

## Project Motivation
Customer churn is a critical issue in the telecom industry, where retaining customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. By predicting churn and understanding the underlying reasons through sentiment analysis, businesses can implement targeted strategies to improve customer retention.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes customer information and feedback related to their experience with the telecom services. It contains various features such as customer demographics, service usage, and churn status. The dataset was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) (insert the specific link here).

## Data Cleaning
Data cleaning involved:
- Handling missing values
- Correcting data types
- Removing duplicates
- Encoding categorical variables (e.g., `One-Hot Encoding`, `Label Encoding`)

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was performed to uncover insights about customer behavior and churn patterns. Key steps included:
- Visualizing churn distribution across different demographics
- Analyzing the relationship between service usage and churn
- Identifying trends in customer feedback

## Modeling
Machine learning techniques were applied to build predictive models, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

The best model based on performance metrics was identified as follows:

          precision    recall  f1-score   support

       0       0.97      0.94      0.96       551
       1       0.95      0.97      0.96       611

accuracy                           0.96      1162


## Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis was conducted on customer feedback using NLP techniques:
- Text cleaning and preprocessing
- Applying sentiment analysis models
- Analyzing the sentiment distribution in relation to churn status

## Results
The model demonstrated high accuracy and strong predictive performance. The insights gained from sentiment analysis provided valuable context to understand customer feelings towards the services and their correlation with churn.

## Conclusion
This project highlights the importance of combining machine learning and NLP to predict customer churn effectively. By leveraging customer feedback, companies can gain actionable insights that lead to improved retention strategies.

## Future Work
Future improvements may include:
- Implementing more advanced NLP techniques
- Exploring additional features related to customer behavior
- Regularly updating the model with new data
